[**Epay**](https://epaygh.com/)  is a payment service that makes it easier for African businesses to securely accept online payments (both local and International) without coding or having a website and at no cost.

With Epay, a business through a payment page can accept payments from mobile money wallets, Credit or Debit Cards with the lowest transaction fees possible. When a business receives payment, the payment is stored in a wallet provided by Epay for the business and at anytime can be transferred to the business’s preferred bank account or mobile money wallet.

We are building the next generation’s payment service that will allow African Businesses accept online payments easily, allowing them to fully focus on building their business.

If you are a developer, [Epay](https://epaygh.com/) has been designed to allow you extend and easily integrate into systems to accept payments, without worrying about the complexity and risk that comes with processing online payments.

To developers, Epay serves as a webhook-driven checkout-as-a-service. Our well designed and beautiful checkout pages allows you to accept payments for your one-time purchase products and services, and notifies you via webhook whenever a new payment comes through. You don’t need to write a single line of payment code, you only need to worry about how to respond when a payment is successful or not.

A business can accept payment through Epay by **signing up** on [https://www.epaygh.com](https://epaygh.com/), **create a payment page** _(A “_**_Payment Page_**_” can represent anything you want to charge money for, including; a downloadable product, a private course, T-shirt etc)_ and **share the link of the payment page** with customer(s). See our [**FAQ**](https://epaygh.com/#faq)  ([https://epaygh.com/#faq](https://epaygh.com/#faq)) page for more information
